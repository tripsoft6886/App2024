            <p>
                <b>4.2.</b> “Findmykids” determines the child mobile device location by means of a mobile phone triangulation (each 15 minutes) using built into phone GPS unit, internet-communication
                system (WiFi) and mobile internet. The Service tracks to the parents (who have an installed “Findmykids” app) the transferring and provides an access to the child mobile device location
                which uses “Pingo: Chat With Parents” app, therefore the child must be added to the parents profile. The parent might add an unlimited number of children to his/her profile. Besides, the
                Service includes the following list of features:
            </p>
            <p>
                - retransmits sounds near the child mobile device to the parent's device;
            </p>
            <p>
                - determines the device settings which may harm the normal app work and helps to fix it;
            </p>
            <p>
                - displays the child tracking history at the parent's device;
            </p>
            <p>
                - sends notifications to the parent's mobile phone on which “Findmykids” app is installed in case a child leaves the marked area;
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                - allows to send the motivated hearts (emoji) to the child phone;
            </p>
            <p>

                “app name of installed on the child phone – usage in percent for a particular period;

                - other functions according to the acquired license.
            </p>
            <p>
                The parents should be aware that the accuracy of the child's location depends on many factors, such as mobile network coverage, connection stability,
                and so on. For example, if the child is in a building or area with poor network coverage, the map may not be displayed correctly and the child's location
                may not match the actual location on the map. This may seem obvious, but the child's location on the map is the location of their device. For example,
                if the child forgot their device or gave it to a friend, the app will show the location of the device instead of where the child is physically located.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>4.3.</b> There are the features which are aimed on collecting and exchanging of information regarding your location, you and other persons who use the Service.

                relevant settings allowing to collect and share the data and location data are switched off. Besides this, the features might not be working properly for various

                finding feature is disabled, if the Service is not used or blocked on the device and etc.

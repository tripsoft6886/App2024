                The “Findmykids” app, which is intended for adults only, allows Users to create a profile. When You create such a profile, We may collect Your personal
                information, such as email address, gender, or cell phone number. We also may collect Your general location data such as country or region (We do not
                collect your precise geolocation).
            </p>
            <p>
                The “Pingo: Chat with Parents” app is intended for children. It can be set up by an adult or a child. If the app is set up by a child, We first request a parent's
                code from the “Findmykids” app. These apps need to be used together. The only personal information we ask for within the “Pingo: Chat with Parents” is the child's age.
            </p>
            <p>
                When You as a parent set up the child's “Pingo: Chat with Parents,” Your parental “Findmykids” app is connected to that child's phone, and You as a parent may
                create a child's profile within the “Findmykids” app by providing the following personal information:
            </p>
            <p>
                - Child's nickname. This nickname is not displayed publicly.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Avatar picture. Only a picture that does not identify the child can be used. The Company does not store photos of the child on its server,
                and only the parent is allowed to access this data.
            </p>
            <p>
                - GPS watch photos. The Company does not store photos of the child on its server, and only the parent is allowed to access this data.

                (improvement of our Services). During the app's set up, We will ask You whether You want to turn the geolocation tracking on. You can later change

            <p>
                - Sound around the child's device per request of the parent: you as a parent can choose to listen live to your child's device's surroundings
                for 20 seconds (if You are within 2 meters of Your child's phone). Your child needs to have the
                “Pingo: Chat With Parents” app installed. Listening and recording are allowed only for the users with the “Findmykids” app installed and

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3.1.1.</b> The Company takes special precautions to protect the privacy of children. The Company does not knowingly collect personal information from children
                under the age of 13 without verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian. Some of our Services are intended to be used by children under 13. In that case,
                it's only with significant parental involvement upon the setup of the Service (e.g., the connection of the “Pingo: Chat with Parents” app with the parental
                “Findmykids” app) and receipt of verifiable parental consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3.1.2.</b> If the Company learns that we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child without parental consent, we will take appropriate steps
                to delete this information as soon as possible. Although this is highly unlikely to happen, if you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under
                the age of 13 has a registered account with our Service without your consent, please alert us immediately by emailing privacy@findmykids-studio.com so that we may
                delete that child’s personal information from our systems and terminate any account your child has created with us.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3.1.3.</b> Verifiable parental consent is obtained using the email plus consent mechanism under COPPA. We will request that You as a parent
                provide your email address, where we will send you an email to verify your email address and a consent email. You will be asked to either open
                a link sent in the consent email or add a verification code on your device during the setup of the “Findmykids” app. The “Pingo: Chat with
                Parents” app cannot be used before you enter your code accessible in the “Findmykids” app.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will then send you one more email to confirm that We have received your consent, with information on how to revoke it.

                request. To change or delete push notifications, visit the settings section on your device and select the appropriate setting, or change the settings on your
